7. Close DevTools
8. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

#### Method 2: Browser Console
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Type and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload(true);
```

#### Method 3: Complete Browser Clear

## 🔄 If You Need Dark Mode Back

You would need to:
1. Recreate the `ThemeProvider` component
2. Add `darkMode: 'class'` back to `tailwind.config.js`
3. Re-add `dark:` classes to every component (manually or via git)
4. Update layout.tsx to include ThemeProvider
5. Re-add theme toggle button to header

**Estimated time to restore:** 2-3 hours of manual work
